# cs30 major Project propasal 

## Description
- for this project I'm thinking of creating a chicken crossing the road style game where the chicken crosses the road and needs to avoid getting hit by cars or buses or bikes. The chicken will also need to cross a stream by jumping on logs floating down the stream.
## Needs To Have
- Different obstacles for the chicken to dodge
- A win condition where the chicken makes it accross a certain number of roads and/or streams
- A lose condition where the chicken gets hit by a car or falls in the stream
- Basic movement for the chicken like moving forward and possibly jumping
- Varying speeds for the obstacles on the road
- sound effects
## Nice To Have
- randomized number of streams or roads
- varying widths for the roads and streams
- A limited amount of time to stay on a log before it sinks
