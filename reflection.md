# Major Project Reflection 

## What advice would I give myself?
- I would tell myself to gain better knowledge about the new stuff that I'm trying to implement so I don't get stuck trying to figure something out

## Did I get all my Needs To Have?
- I got everything in my needs to have asside from a lose condition and sound effects

## The hardest Part
- The hardest part for me was detecting collision between my chicken and the vehichles

## Was there any Problems I could not Solve?
- I was unable to set up collision between the chicken and vehichles
- I also was anable to set up sound effects
